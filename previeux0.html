            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>The One and Only Ivan is a heartwarming and moving story inspired by the real-life tale of Ivan, a
                gorilla who lived in captivity for 27 years in a shopping mall. The novel is narrated by Ivan himself,
                offering a unique and deeply emotional perspective.

                Ivan is a silverback gorilla who lives in the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. His home is a
                glass-enclosed domain, and he spends his days watching TV, drawing pictures, and observing humans. Ivan
                has friendsâ€”Stella, an elderly elephant, and Bob, a stray dog who sneaks into his enclosure. Despite his
                circumstances, Ivan has grown accustomed to captivity and doesn't often think about his life in the
                wild.

                Everything changes when Ruby, a baby elephant, arrives at the mall. Ruby's arrival prompts Ivan to see
                their captivity through fresh eyes. Inspired by Stella's wish for Ruby to live a better life, Ivan
                begins to use his artistic talents to draw attention to their plight and find a way to save her.
